<h2>Optical  Character  Recognition  of  Handwritten  Arabic  Numerals/Digitsusing Artificial Neural Networks</h2>


Optical character recognition is the automated conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or  printed  text  into machine-encoded  text,  whether  from  a  scanned  document,  a  photo  of  a document,  a  scene-photo  (e.g.,the  text  on  signs  and  billboards  in  a  landscape  photo)  or  from  subtitle  text superimposed on an image (e.g.,from a television broadcast). <br>
Build an this using Artificial Neural Networks to identify Handwritten Arabic Numerals (Arabic Numbers: ١,٢,٣... ).<br>
